# [Max's Portfolio](https://maxthakur.xyz) Api
The original version of my portfolio had used last.fm, but they send a lot unneeded data. So I made this as a drop-in replacement.

## Notes
**The refresh key is dynamic, so every single time you restart the app you have to visit the update url given in the console**

## License
For this project I have chose the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) it's specified in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.
